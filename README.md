# Jenell's Portfolio
###Jenell Pizarro's Front End Engineering Portfolio   
A culmination of projects I'm proud of, contact information, and a little bit about me. 

##First Bootstrap!

A boiler-plate was used but I was able to manipulate most of it. 

This portfolio showcases what projects I have done. It will continue to show the projects I will be doing and change, as far as design goes, rather continuosly. Never be satisfied.
